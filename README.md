In the modern digital era, data has become a vital strategic asset for
organizations to gain valuable insights and drive innovation. However, research
shows that most companies are unable to leverage their data to its full potential due to
widespread fragmentation across disparate systems and information silos (IBM,
2017). This report examines the case of Orchid Technologies, a UK-based small and
medium enterprise (SME), aiming to expand globally but facing significant
challenges with its customer data scattered across various isolated systems.

After thoroughly assessing Orchid's needs, this report recommends
implementing modern big data architectures using flexible NoSQL databases to
consolidate and unify data. This will provide the foundational integrated data asset to
deploy advanced analytics, machine learning, and AI to extract actionable intelligence
to guide business strategy and operations. The report also deeply analyzes the
multifaceted implications around regulations, infrastructure, security, and
organizational culture involved in Orchid's ambitious international expansion plans. A
staged, strategic technology roadmap is proposed to guide Orchid in its journey
towards becoming an insights-driven global enterprise.

The Growing Imperative for Integrated Data
Orchid's customer data currently resides in fragmented silos across its human
resources, financial, CRM, and other operational systems, with no consolidation or
integration (Hartshorne et al., 2020). Employees expend tremendous manual effort to
try to correlate and assemble this disparate data in an attempt to gain unified 360-
degree views of customers.
However, legacy relational databases, which Orchid currently relies on, can
only handle predefined structured data (Hecht & Jablonski, 2011). In contrast, over
80% of business data today is unstructured, originating from social media, multimedia
content, sensors, web activity logs, and other sources (IBM, 2014). This exacerbates
Orchid's data fragmentation challenges. The lack of integrated, holistic data severely
limits Orchid's ability to implement emerging big data technologies like machine
learning, predictive analytics, and AI that require large, harmonized datasets to deliver

actionable insights (Tan et al., 2018). Data unification is thus absolutely critical and
urgent for Orchid's future innovation, growth, and resilience.
Achieving Seamless Data Consolidation
The Python ETL process undertaken for Orchid highlighted that combining its
siloed customer data from discrete sources like CSV files, JSON documents, and
XML feeds into unified 360-degree profiles requires extensive design considerations.
Inserting the aggregated data into MySQL using PonyORM meets Orchid's
transactional processing requirements. However, rigid schemas limit the ability to
efficiently adapt to the rapid real-world evolution of complex big data landscapes
(Hecht & Jablonski, 2011). NoSQL databases address such constraints through
flexible, schema-agnostic data models. Especially relevant is MongoDB, whose
document-oriented structure can seamlessly integrate disparate formats like CSV,
JSON, and XML into a consistent structure of JSON-like documents without
restrictions (Hows et al., 2015). This agility makes MongoDB ideal for handling
Orchid's highly fluid, variable data while still enabling analytical querying (Hecht &amp;
Jablonski, 2011).
Consolidating Orchid's multisourced customer data in MongoDB will thus
provide the integrated, harmonized foundation required to unlock advanced big data
capabilities for actionable insights that can catalyze innovation and growth.
Building Scalable and Flexible Big Data Architectures
While adequate for current needs, detailed projections indicate Orchid&#39;s
infrastructure requires significant upgrading to handle the exponential big data growth
anticipated from its expanding national and international operations (Mikalef et al.,
2019). MongoDB distributed, horizontally scalable architecture will allow
seamlessly scaling across clusters of servers to accommodate surging data volumes
(Lith et al., 2010). Its fault-tolerant clustered design provides enhanced performance,
availability, and reliability vital for large-scale consolidated data assets (Banker,
2011). Further, selectively blending MongoDB versatile consolidation capabilities
with other specialized NoSQL models can create optimized, enterprise-grade scalable
architectures.
